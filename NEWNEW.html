        <p class="maintext" id="maintext">What in Cthulhu’s left testicle did you just vocalize to me, you sniveling little shit of a bioform? I’ll have you know I own multiple universes, and I’ve created and destroyed more civilizations than you have words in your language. I am a master memelord and am ranked as the #1 most cancer-causing individual in history. You are nothing but a weak matter-based lifeform. I will wreck your ass with an accuracy that the top 10 players in Counter-Strike WISH they had, mark my goddamn words. You think you can spew shit like that out of your mouth orifice and live? You better rethink that line of thought, fuckface. As we speak I am already re-writing your timeline to give you malignant tumorous growths, and I’d say you have 20, maybe 30 less years to live than you did before, so you better write that obituary, scrublord. Your entire life is going to end on an even sadder and more painful note than it was going to before. It’s over for you asshole. I can be everything and nothing at any given time. I can give you over 9,000 varieties of leukemia, and that’s with Robbie Rotten memes alone. Not only can I control your existence like a pinball machine, but you don’t even know where I’ll strike from next. I could be your planet, I could be your friends, I could even be you. I can spam your pathetic existence with anything I choose, and there’s nothing you can do about it kiddo. If only your mind were large enough for you to comprehend the enormity of your mistake, perhaps you would have withheld your primal animal impulses. But you gave in to your inner idiot and let loose with the atrocity you call a “comment”. Now I will make you wish you never chose that path, you buffoon. I will force my middle finger so far up your ass you’ll be able to climb it, and then I’ll make you take that climb. Your tight little gremlin ass is about to get wasted.</p>
