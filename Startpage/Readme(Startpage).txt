Warning(or some sort):
The code is a mess in some places, and I am aware of it.
(Don't feel like I want to dedicate time fixing the thing.)

Some problems with code:
The page is not responsive to the size of the window.
The elements are not the size they need to be.
/
And probably a few more thing...

Enjoy, I guess :D
